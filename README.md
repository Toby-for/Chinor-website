## Flask Application

A simple Flask application provides user registration, login, a protected dashboard, and logout functionality.

### Setup

Install dependencies and run the app:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The application uses an in-memory user dictionary for demonstration purposes.
